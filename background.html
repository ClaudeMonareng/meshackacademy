                    <ul>
                        <li>We are a specialised Mathematics, Science and Digital Technology tutoring academy that is built to be 
                            a solution to critial pressing challenges
                            that are experienced in public schools, most especially public rural schools. We integrate digital 
                            technology into our classroom curriculum management and delivery to differentiate ourselves as both
                            leaders and pioneers in digital learning to improve our students' participation, academic growth and
                            quality pass rate, in the KwaZulu-Natal province. Our vision is to build cohorts of excelling and thriving 
                            students in their respective schools, to excel and thrive for themselves, for their schools, families and 
                            community</li>
                        <li>Public schooling system is beholden by a persisting structural socio-economic problem of classroom overcrowding, 
                            that is caused by public school infrastructure incapacity and increasing learner population. Overcrowding significantly 
                            compromises the quality of content management and delivery, learner management, student feedback and performance. It is a key factor that 
                            seperates low performing schools from high performing schools.</li>
                        <li>At best the number of students per classroom is between 20 and 25 students per lesson. Yet the number of students in
                            public schools on average ranges between 50 to 98 per lesson. Each of these students comes from a different socio-economic 
                            background, harbours a unique personality and requires a unique approach of content delivery that is responsive to their 
                            level of grasp. With such a number of factors, how can a 
                            teacher deliver content effectively to make sure that each learner meaningfully engages and participates? How can a teacher 
                            effectively track student participation and performance? How can a teacher ensure that each and every learner receives 
                            the close and personalised attention that they need?</li>
                        <li>At Monareng Academy, we are a short, medium and long term solution to the above identified problem statements. We ensure that our 
                            lessons have a maximum of 15 students per lesson. Our small classes allow us to deliver
                            content ensuring that each student is meaningfully engaged and stimulated to participate effectvely. We routinely mark, track
                            and record our students' performance in every activity that they do. We ensure they keep up with the highest standards of 
                            academic outcomes when they in their respective schools.</li>
                        <li>With the high and increasing cost of living in South Africa, increasing youth unemploment, uncertain global economic landscape, 
                            increase of tertiary jobs that demand higher skills levels and persisting socials such as poverty and teenage pregnancy, quality 
                            education is the only key to personal, socio-economic and psychological liberation. It is need, a prescription not a want, especially
                            for a black child, a black rural child.</li>
